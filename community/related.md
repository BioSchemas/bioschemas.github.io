# Bioschemas in Context

The major advantage of Schema.org markup is in making metadata readily accessible to common web tools, enabling their harvesting on a huge scale, by general and commercial indexers such as Google.

## Science On Schema
Bioschemas is not alone in developing a strategy to generate a Life Science targeted, opinionated derivation of this markup; the [ESIP](https://github.com/ESIPFed/science-on-schema.org) Science-On-Schema.org group has produced an evolving set of guidelines to assist with consistent implementation of scientific dataset descriptions using the Schema.org vocabulary. Indeed, the Science-On-Schema.org work is the output of one of several [groups](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/research-metadata-schemas-wg) operating in diverse domains, and targeting their own opinionated versions of Schema.org, ideally and ultimately to be integrated into Schema.org proper. A useful output of this group is a [crosswalk](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P6WH8h4OnIVR9UJj3FcOebNUpLnKNBCuvEp3NsLRho4/edit#gid=0) between Schema.org and other (and sometimes equivalent) properties expressed through other terminologies and standards. Note: other [crosswalks](https://zenodo.org/record/4420116#.YIMuFGhKg2y) are also available.
