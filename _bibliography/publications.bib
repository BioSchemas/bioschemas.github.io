abstract = {Websites are commonly used to expose data to end users, enabling
search, filter, and download capabilities making it easier for users to find, organize
and obtain data relevant to their own interests. With the continuous growth of
data in the Life Sciences domain, it becomes difficult for users to easily find information
required for their research on one single website. Search engines
should make it easier for researchers to search and retrieve collated information
from multiple sites so they can better decide where to go next. Schema.org is a
collaborative project providing schemas for semantically structuring data in web
pages. By adding semantic mark-up it becomes easier to determine whether a
web page refers to a book or a movie. It also facilitates summarizing information
in a fashion similar to infoboxes used in Wikipedia. Bioschemas is a community
effort aiming to extend schema.org to support mark-up for Life Sciences websites.
Here we present an overview of the main types used and proposed by Bioschemas
in order to support such mark up. Availability: http://bioschemas.org/},

abstract = {The life sciences have a wealth of data resources with a wide range of overlapping content. Key repositories, such as UniProt for protein data or Entrez Gene for gene data, are well known and their content easily discovered through search engines. However, there is a long-tail of bespoke datasets with important content that are not so prominent in search results. Building on the success of Schema.org for making a wide range of structured web content more discoverable and interpretable, e.g. food recipes, the Bioschemas community (http://bioschemas.org) aim to make life sciences datasets more findable by encouraging data providers to embed Schema.org markup in their resources.},

Abstract
Schema.org provides a way to add semantic markup to web pages. It describes ‘types’ of information, which then have ‘properties’. For example, ‘Event’ is a type that has properties like ‘startDate’, ‘endDate’ and ‘description’. Bioschemas aims to improve data interoperability in life sciences by encouraging people in life science to use schema.org markup. This structured information then makes it easier to discover, collate and analyse distributed data. Bioschemas reuses and extends schema.org in a number of ways: defining a minimum information model for the datatype being described using as few concepts as possible and only where necessary adding new properties, and the introduction of cardinalities and controlled vocabularies. The main outcome of Bioschemas is a collection of specifications that provide guidelines to facilitate a more consistent adoption of schema.org markup within the life sciences for the “Find” part of the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles.
In 2016 Bioschemas successfully piloted with training materials and events to enable the EU ELIXIR Research Infrastructure Training Portal (TeSS) to rapidly and simply harvest metadata from community sites. Encouraged by this in March 2017 we launched a 12 month project to pilot Bioschemas for data repositories and datasets. Specifically we are working on:
General descriptions for datasets and data repositories
Specific descriptions for prioritised datatypes: Samples, Human Beacons, Plant phenotypes and Protein annotations
Facilitating discovery by registries and data aggregators, and by general search engines
Facilitate tool development for annotation and validation of compliant resources
All work is grounded on describing real data resources for real use cases: to this end large and small dataset are part of the project: Pfam, Interpro, PDBe, UniProt, BRENDA, EGA, COPaKB, and Gene3D. Data aggregators participating include: InterMine, BioSamples and OmicsDI. Registries include Identifiers.org, DataMed, Biosharing and the Beacon Network. Bioschemas operates as an open community initiative, sponsored by the EU ELIXIR Research Infrastructure and is supported by the NIH BD2K programme and Google.},

	abstract = {Validating RDF data becomes necessary in order to ensure data compliance against the conceptualization model it follows, e.g., schema or ontology behind the data, and improve data consistency and completeness. There are different approaches to validate RDF data, for instance, JSON schema, particularly for data in JSONLD format, as well as Shape Expression and Shapes Constraint Language, which can be used with other serialization as well, e.g., RDF/XML or Turtle. Currently, no validation approach is prevalent regarding others, selection commonly depends on data characteristics, background knowledge and personal preferences . In some cases, the approaches are interchangeable; however, that is not always the case, making it necessary to identify a subset among them that can be seamlessly translated from one to another. During the NBDC/DBCLS 2019 BioHackathon, we worked on a variety of topics related to RDF data validation, including (i) development of ShEx shapes for a number of datasets, (ii) development of a tool to semi-automatically create ShEx shapes, (iii) improvements to the RDFShape tool, and (iv) enabling validation schema conversion from one format to the other. Here we report on our BioHackathon achievements.},
