# Getting Started with Bioschemas

[Bioschemas](/) aims to improve findability and interoperability for Life Science resources. It does so by guiding the use of [Schema.org](https://schema.org/) markup on Life Science websites. Guidelines include recommendations on the properties to be used together with the cardinality, ONE or MANY. It also offers recommendation on some well-known ontology terms for some particular properties. All those recommendations are what we call a "[__Bioschemas Profile__](/profiles)".

If what we just said is not so clear to you yet, do not worry about; this training portal is here to help you understand how to use Bioschemas Profiles. Find below the right place to start with.
- If you are new to schema.org and Bioschemas, please start with [What and why Schema.org]()
- If you already know about schema.org and want to learn more Bioschemas, please go to [What and why Bioschemas]()
- If you already know about schema.org and Bioschemas, and you are ready to add markup to your resource, then go to our _How to_ section, [Starting by the selection of the right profile for your case]()
