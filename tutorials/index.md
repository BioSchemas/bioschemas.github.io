# Getting Started with Bioschemas
>_A quick tour on what this training portal offers_


[Bioschemas](/) aims to improve findability and interoperability for Life Science resources. It does so by guiding the use of [Schema.org](https://schema.org/) markup on Life Science websites. Guidelines include recommendations on the properties to be used together with the cardinality, ONE or MANY. It also offers recommendation on some well-known ontology terms for some particular properties. All those recommendations are what we call a "[__Bioschemas Profile__](/profiles)". Bioschemas also leads the development and posterior inclusion in Schema.org of some common types used in Life Sciences, i.e., [__Bioschemas types__](/types).

If what we just said is not so clear to you yet, do not worry about it; this training portal is here to help you understand how to use Bioschemas Types and Profiles. Find below the right place to start with.

We have identified four audience groups who might be interested in Bioschemas tutorials. On each tutorial, as part of the "audience" description, we will always include which group we think a tutorial mostly applies to. The four audience groups are:
* General interest: people who want to get introduced to Bioschemas
* Specification developers: people who want to contribute to the creation and development of specifications (either types or profiles)
* Markup provider/content creator/web developer (Markup provider for short): people interested in adding Bioschemas markup to their web pages
* Markup consumer/user (Markup consumer for short): people who are interested in consuming the markup offered by the providers group

## Brief introduction to Schema.org and Bioschemas

All tutorials in this section target the "General interest" audience group. If you fall in any of the other groups but are fairly new to the topic, we invite you to start your journey here.

- If you are new to Schema.org and Bioschemas, please start with [What and why Schema.org](./what_why_schema)
- If you already know about Schema.org and want to get a better understanding on structured data benefits, please go have a look at our [pratical example on Schema.org markup](./markup_examples). 
  - "Markup provider" planning to add Bioschemas markup on their web pages will find here initial information on how such marku up looks like on the page and behind the scenes
  - "Markup consumer" planning to exploit existing markup will find here find here initial information on how such marku up looks like on the page and behind the scenes
- If you already know about Schema.org and want to learn more Bioschemas, please go to [What and why Bioschemas](./what_why_bioschemas)

## How-to guidelines
- Main target audience "Markup provider", secondary target audience "Markup consumer"
  - If you already know about Schema.org and Bioschemas, and you are ready to add markup to your resource, then go to our _How to_ section, [Starting by the selection of the right profile for your case](./howto/howto_right_profile). This tutorial targets "Markup providers)
  - If you want to add Bioschema structured data to your pages, then go to our _How to_ section and learn how to [add markup to your own resource](./howto/howto_add_markup)
  - If you want to add markup to a GitHub pages, go to our _How to_ section and find information on [marking up on GitHub pages](./howto/howto_add_github)
  - To check your that markup is deployed and can be retrieved by others, see our guide on [checking your deployed markup](./howto/howto_check_deploy)
- Target audience "Specification developer"
  - If you want to [create a new profile](./howto/howto_create_new_profile), our _How to_ includes all the information you need to do so. 
  - If you need to create a new version of an existing profile then go to our _How to_ section and learn about how to [update a profile](./howto/howto_new_profile_version)
