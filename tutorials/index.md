# Getting Started with Bioschemas
>_A quick tour on what this training portal offers_


[Bioschemas](/) aims to improve findability and interoperability for Life Science resources. It does so by guiding the use of [Schema.org](https://schema.org/) markup on Life Science websites. Guidelines include recommendations on the properties to be used together with the cardinality, ONE or MANY. It also offers recommendation on some well-known ontology terms for some particular properties. All those recommendations are what we call a "[__Bioschemas Profile__](/profiles)". Bioschemas also leads the development and posterior inclusion in Schema.org of some common types used in Life Sciences, i.e., [__Bioschemas types__](/types).

If what we just said is not so clear to you yet, do not worry about it; this training portal is here to help you understand how to use Bioschemas Types and Profiles. Find below the right place to start with.

## Brief introduction to Schema.org and Bioschemas
- If you are new to Schema.org and Bioschemas, please start with [What and why Schema.org](./what_why_schema)
- If you already know about Schema.org and want to get a better understanding on structured data benefits, please go have a look at our [pratical example on Schema.org markup](./markup_examples)
- If you already know about Schema.org and want to learn more Bioschemas, please go to [What and why Bioschemas](./what_why_bioschemas)

## How-to guidelines
- If you already know about Schema.org and Bioschemas, and you are ready to add markup to your resource, then go to our _How to_ section, [Starting by the selection of the right profile for your case](./howto/howto_right_profile)
- If you want to [create a new profile](./howto/howto_create_new_profile), our _How to_ includes all the information you need to do so
- If you want to add Bioschema structured data to your pages, then go to our _How to_ section and learn how to [add markup to your own resource](./howto/howto_add_markup)
- If you want to add markup to a GitHub pages, go to our _How to_ section and find information on [marking up on GitHub pages](./howto/howto_add_github)
- To check your that markup is deployed and can be retrieved by others, see our guide on [checking your deployed markup](./howto/howto_check_deploy)
