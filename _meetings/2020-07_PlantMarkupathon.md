As part of the ELIXIR Interoperability Platform Strategic Implementation Study, we will be working with the [Plant Sciences Community](https://elixir-europe.org/communities/plant-sciences) to develop markup for their resources.

> AIM | Develop markup to embed in plant community resources to enable them to be indexed and aggregated by the FAIDARE registry without needing to stand up a BrAPI service.

This meeting follows on from the discussions at the ELIXIR All Hands 2020 Interoperability Workshop discussions on Phenotypes, Studies, and Experiments.
