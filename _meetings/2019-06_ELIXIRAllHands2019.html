<p>The Findability of resources on the Web can be boosted by including <a href="https://schema.org">Schema.org</a> semantic markup within their web pages. Schema.org is a community effort supported by the major search engines, and is already widely implemented across the web for products and events.</p>

<p>Bioschemas has been working to extend Schema.org to include biological types like genes and proteins with the aim to improve the discoverability and use of life sciences resources. Additionaly, Bioschemas provides profiles over existing Schema.org types to simplify the task of developing markup for life sciences resources.</p>

<p>In this workshop, you will learn about Bioschemas, its approach and its principles, and how this will help your resource become more Findable on the Web. Focus will be on practical hands-on sessions where developers learn how to annotate their resources using Bioschemas profiles.</p>

<p>If you missed the registration deadline, do not worry. Come along and join us anyway.</p>
