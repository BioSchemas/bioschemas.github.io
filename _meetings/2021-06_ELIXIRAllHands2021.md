Bioschemas will be taking an active part in the Data Management Workshop during the ELIXIR All Hands Meeting 2021. We'll be running a hands on session to support web resources to embed markup in order to make their data more discoverable on the Web. Full details of the session are in the [agenda document]({{agenda-doc}}).

In the morning session we'll be giving a presentation, "Bioschemas: Findability at Web Scale".
> Bioschemas makes web resources more discoverable by extending Schema.org for the life sciences. Bioschemas provides usage guidelines to embed markup in a consistent manner.
Markup in websites can be scraped and used to facilitate dedicated search portals as well as lightweight integration.

In the afternoon we'll be running a help desk to support resources to embed markup in their site.
> Want to make your resource more discoverable on the Web? Struggling to embed markup within your site? We’re here to help. Whether you’re just starting or wanting to update your markup to the latest profiles, come along and get dedicated support.
