                 <p>Conferences, workshops, meetings and events in general play a very important role in knowledge sharing
                   and acquisition of new skills. Though there are several technological solutions for event sharing, events
                   in life sciences are still not described in a consistent manner that would make them easy to discover, exchange or compare.</p>
                <p>Because there is no single standard to follow, the dissemination, discovery and aggregation of events is not effective. As a result,
                  the advertisement of an event in third party websites normally requires manual curation to shape the content to each providerâ€™s requirements.</p>
