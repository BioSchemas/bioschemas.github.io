<h3>Objectives</h3>

<ol>
<li>Develop the metadata markup to find and register a workflow in a registry and exchange metadata between workflow registries</li>
<li>Advocate for the adoption of the markup in workflow registries and repositories</li>
<li>Advocate for the adoption of the markup by workflow management systems</li>
<li>Advocate for the development of tools to support the markup and its use</li>
                      </ol>

<h3>Use Cases</h3>
<p>There are a large number of computational workflow formats and systems. In the absence of common metadata, it is impossible to find or compare suitable workflow(s).</p>
<p>The <a href="https://workflowhub.eu">WorkflowHub</a> allows the registration of diverse workflows, and exposes them through the agreed metadata</p>
<p>The metadata has been developed by <a href="https://bioschema.org/groups/Workflow">Workflow group</a>. The group includes members from many computational workflow communities, including <a href="https://galaxyproject.org/">Galaxy</a>, <a href="https://www.nextflow.io/">Nextflow</a>, <a href="https://snakemake.readthedocs.io">Snakemake</a> and <a href="https://scipion-em.github.io/docs/">Scipion</a>.</p>
