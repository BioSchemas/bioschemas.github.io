                 <h3>Findability</h3>
                 <p>As an user, I will like to search for protocols according to:</p>
                 <ul>
                 <li>availability of reagents and/or equipment in my lab, also</li>
                 <li>the sample to be tested, and/or</li>
                 <li>the overall objective of the protocol. </li>
                 </ul>
                 <p>Searching for protocols using these four elements helps me (as an user) to decide
                 on the suitability of the protocol(s) that should be executed during an experiment or assay.</p>

                 <h3>Summarization</h3>
                 <p>As an user, whenever I look for a lab protocol (A.K.A experimental protocol), I would like to see a quick summary with information related to: the sample to be tested (e.g. whole organisms, anatomical parts, biomolecules, body fluids), the list of equipment (including standard and high-throughput equipment, consumables), the software used, the list of reagents (e.g. bought ready-to-use, solutions or mixtures prepared in the lab, media, buffers, kits), the overall objective of the protocol (to know about the suitability), the protocol identifier (that helps me to find a protocol) and the license.</p>

                 <h3>Link to external resources</h3>
                 <p>As a user of a protocol I would  like to know where could I buy equipment and/or reagents used in a particular protocol.
                 Rationale: For this reason, it is important to include information about the manufacturers, catalog number and homepage of equipments and reagents.</p>
                 <p>As a user,  I would like to know previous uses/applications of a protocol; who has used it, who has built derivations of it, are those derivations related to the sample, instrument, reagent or objective?</p>
                 <p>Finally. As a user of the protocol I would like to know where is the data derived from the application of the protocol - if publicly available then where?'</p>
