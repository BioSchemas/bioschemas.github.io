                 <p>The overall aim is findability and not structured queries. Based on this, the key use cases that have driven the selection of the fields are the following:</p>
                 <ol>
                   <li>Search on a title of dataset</li>
                   <li>Enable discovery by indexing on free text description</li>
                   <li>Enable direct access, resolution of dataset</li>
                   <li>Allow restriction to specific dimensions and variables specifically recorded in a dataset (e.g. get all climate datasets which have monitors CO2 concentration or datasets where metabolite concentration was recorded)</li>
                   <li>Search according to the repository of the datasets</li>
                   <li>Search according to creator, author</li>
                   <li>Allow restriction to how a dataset has been generated (e.g. get all climate datasets if metabolite concentration was recorded if acquired using mass spectrometry)</li>
                 </ol>
