<h2>Biotea 2 Bioschemas - Introduction</h2>
<p>Biotea defines a model for metadata, references, content and named entities recognized in
  the text. Bioschemas profiles for scholarly publications focus on metadata only.
</p>
<p>How to cite Biotea: <br/>

<h3>Biotea model for metadata at a glance</h3>
<img src="https://dfzljdn9uc3pi.cloudfront.net/2018/4201/1/fig-3-2x.jpg" alt="Biotea model"/>

<h2>Use cases</h2>
<p>
  The following use cases were derived from Biotea but they apply in general to search and retrieval of literature
  metadata and associated entities. A user here is anyone looking for literature related metadata and associated
  entities, e.g., a researcher trying to find articles about a particular protein or a researcher looking for
  literature metadata in a standard format so they can create a literature metadata parser or aggregator.
</p>
<h3>Findability</h3>
<p>
  As a user, I want to easily find scholarly publications available on the web, regardless of where
  they are all hosted. As a user, whenever possible, I also want to find biological
  entities recognized in the text and use these to discover scholarly publications about the entity.
</p>
<p>
  Bioschemas markup can enable an extended version of Google Scholar, where even
  institution hosted documents can be found, as far as they are marked up following the Scholarly Publication
  profiles.
</p>

<h3>Accessibility</h3>
<p>
  As a user, I want to get literature metadata in a standard format, regardless of whether all articles are
  hosted on the same website or provide a specialized API.
</p>
<p>
  As publications are marked up with Schema.org/Bioschemas, their key elements can be easily
  accessible by people and machines. Currently, the
  <a href="http://jats.niso.org/1.1/" target="_blank">Journal Article Tag Suite</a> is the default
  format supported by the main publishers in the Life Sciences domain. The JATS XML format
  is a comprehensive one including metadata, abstract, content and references. The format though
  lacks support for Linked Data. JSON is also supported via web services by some repositories
  such as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/" target="_blank">PubMed</a>
  -- see <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25500/" target="_blank">e-utils tools</a>,
  and <a href="https://europepmc.org/" target="_blank">Europe PMC</a>, see
  <a href="https://europepmc.org/RestfulWebService" target="_blank">RESTful services</a>.
  Biotea adds a semantic
  layer on top of JATS as well as an easy way to access content, via annotations, with no need to
  expose it all.

<h3>Summarization</h3>
<p>
  As a user, I want to see a summary similar to those for movies when I search for articles. This would become possible thanks to Schema.org/Bioschemas
  markup, providing a quick view of the publication.
</p>
<p>
  Imagine you go to Google Scholar or Wikidata (or any other place aggregating scholarly
  publications metadata (it could be your institute or your own aggregating tool), thanks to Bioschemas markup, such
  websites could also include a summary of, for instance, citing publications on the last 3 months!
</p>

<h3>Interoperability</h3>
<p>
  As a user, I would like to know what publications involve proteins; even more, I would like to know what proteins
  are mentioned in the text.
</p>
<p>
  By adding some "about" data to literature markup, e.g., proteins, it could be possible
  to filter publications by the BioChemEntity they mention.
