                 <h2>Biotea 2 Bioschemas - Introduction</h2>
                 <p>Biotea defines a model for metadata, references, content and names entities recognized in 
                    the text. Bioschemas profiles for scholarly publications focus on metadata only.
                  </p>

                  <h3>Findability</h3>
                  <p>
                     Easily finding scholarly publication available on the web for the research community, 
                     related to entities used in their domain (via annotations with specialized vocabularies)
                  </p>

                  <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                  <p>
                     As publications are marked up with schema.org/Bioschemas, their key elements can be easily 
                     accessible by people and machines. Currently, the 
                     <a href="http://jats.niso.org/1.1/" target="_blank">Journal Article Tag Suite</a> is the default 
                     format supported by main publishers (at least in the Life Sciences domain. The JATS XML format 
                     is a comprehensive one including metadata, abstract, content and references. The format though 
                     lacks support for Linked Data. JSON is also supported via web services by some repositories 
                     such as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/" target="_blank">PubMed</a> 
                     -- see <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25500/" target="_blank">e-utils tools</a>, 
                     and <a href="https://europepmc.org/" target="_blank">Europe PMC</a>, see 
                     <a href="https://europepmc.org/RestfulWebService" target="_blank">RESTful services</a>. 
                     Biotea adds a semantic 
                     layer on top of JATS as well as an easy way to access content, via annotations, with no need to 
                     expose it all.

                  <h3>Summarization</h3>
                  <p>
                     A summarization similar to those for movies would become possible thanks to schema.org/Bioschemas
                      markup, providing a quick view regarding a publication.
                  </p>

                  <h3>Interoperability</h3>
                  <p>
                     Interoperability refers to the use of common vocabs and annotation schemas for data 
                     exchange purposes. For instance, by knowing that a protein is a protein then automatic 
                     links can be built to specific dbs. By using common annotation schemas then annotations 
                     can easily be exchanged (use cases for such tasks are part of the annotation ontology or 
                     annotation framework). The exchange should also make it easier to identify the location of 
                     the annotation in the text.
