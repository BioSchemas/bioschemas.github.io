            <h3>ELIXIR Bioschemas: Community Adoption and Training</h3>
            <p>This <a href="https://www.elixir-europe.org/about-us/implementation-studies/bioschemas-community-adoption">implementation study</a> aims to lift Bioschemas from "pilot" to "practice" and will:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Disseminate and Train: Develop training material; improve the Bioschemas website; make compliant datasets visible in ELIXIR registries.</li>
              <li>Adopt: Topic specific workshops; Node-based workshops and inter-node staff exchange; strategic engagement with data platform Core Data Resources and implementation studies.</li>
              <li>Sustain: Incorporation into Schema.org; and establish Bioschemas Community governance.</li>
              <li>Impact: Highlight use cases, showcase impact stories and identify how to mitigate attrition.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>ELIXIR Bioschemas Implementation Study</h3>
            <p>The aim of this <a href="https://www.elixir-europe.org/about-us/implementation-studies/bioschemas">Implementation Study</a> is to deliver Bioschemas specifications and demonstrators for the following content types: Data repository, Dataset, Sample and Protein annotations. Additionally it will support the development of other content types like Phenotype and Beacons planned in other ELIXIR activities. The project will also provide support and engagement of the Bioschemas community, including meetings, hackathons, knowledge dissemination, and training in adoption of Bioschemas. The project is led by the <a href="https://www.elixir-europe.org/platforms/interoperability/bioschemas">ELIXIR Bioschemas working group</a>.</p>
