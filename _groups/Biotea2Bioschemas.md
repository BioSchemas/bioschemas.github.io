abstract: 'In schema.org we find multiple types to describe scholarly publications. This group aims to define the profiles for those most relevant for publications in sciences, particularly Life Sciences. In order to do so, this group follows the schemas defined by the Biotea project. Biotea encompases elements from multiple ontologies to semantically described enriched articles; it includes metadata, references, structure, content and annotations corresponding to entities recognized in the text by text-mining methods. Citation [1](https://peerj.com/articles/4201/), [2](https://jbiomedsem.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2041-1480-4-S1-S5)'
objectives:
  [
    'Define marginality and cardinality for scholarly publications and related types such as journal, publication issue and publication volume',
    'Recommend some ontologies that can be used as specialized values for some properties'
