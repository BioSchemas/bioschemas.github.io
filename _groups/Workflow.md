abstract: 'A workflow consists of an orchestrated and repeatable pattern of activities enabled by the systematic organization of resources into processes that transform materials, provide services, or process information. It can be depicted as a sequence of operations, the work of a person or group, the work of an organization of staff, or one or more simple or complex mechanisms.'
objectives:
  [
    'Facilitate the ingestion of sample metadata from data repositories (eg. Biobank databases) into registries like the Biosamples, BBMRI Biobank directory or the UKCRC Tissue Directory via Bioschemas.',
    'Engage and help data providers and developers of BioBank LIMS to test and adopt the exposure of sample metadata via Bioschemas',
    'Contribute to contextualise information from data sample registries (eg. Biosamples) and biobank sample repositories (eg. NL Biobank) and Biobank Registries (eg. BBMRI Biobank directory)',
    'Make registries like Biosamples compliant with Bioschemas.'
