# Page attributes
abstract: 'In schema.org we cannot find life science types (eg. protein, gene, biological pathway) except those types that overlap with healthcare and medicine domains defined by the health schema.org extension (eg. drug, artery). These life science types share many elements which can be captured in a common biological entity type.'
objectives:
  [
    'Describe biological entities using Bioschemas compliant markup so biological types can be more easily indexed by search engines and registries.',
    'Evaluating the issues and benefits about how to work with biological entities in schema.org and Bioschemas'
  ]
