    'Investigate the reuse of the Biotea model',
    'Define marginality and cardinality for scholarly publications and related types such as journal, publication issue and publication volume',
    'Recommend some ontologies that can be used as specialized values for some properties'
  ]

<h2>Further Details</h2>
<p>In order to do so, this group follows the schemas defined by the <a herf='http://biotea.github.io/'>Biotea project</a>. Biotea encompases elements from multiple ontologies to semantically described enriched articles; it includes metadata, references, structure, content and annotations corresponding to entities recognized in the text by text-mining methods. Further details about Biotea can be found in the following publications:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://peerj.com/articles/4201/">Biotea: semantics for Pubmed Central</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://jbiomedsem.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2041-1480-4-S1-S5">Biotea: RDFizing PubMed Central in support for the paper as an interface to the Web of Data</a></li>
</ul>
