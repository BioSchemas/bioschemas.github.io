  title: DataRecord
  subtitle: Bioschemas specification describing a record in a dataset.
  description: A Record acts itself as a dataset although it refers to what could
    be seen as the minimum compact, complete and auto-descriptive unit in a dataset,
    i.e., a record. Bioschemas usage In Life Sciences, records will represent a BioChemEntity.

- property: additionalProperty
  expected_types:
  - PropertyValue
  description: 'A property-value pair representing an additional characteristics of
    the entitity, e.g. a product feature or another characteristic for which there
    is no matching property in schema.org. Note: Publishers should be aware that applications
    designed to use specific schema.org properties (e.g. http://schema.org/width,
    http://schema.org/color, http://schema.org/gtin13, ...) will typically expect
    such data to be provided using those properties, rather than using the generic
    property/value mechanism.'

  bsc_description: Additional to the use of [name](http://schema.org/name) and [description](http://schema.org/description)
    to describe this property in a human-readable way, [additionalType](http://schema.org/additionalType)
    should be used to specify the nature of the property/relation. For instance, if
    the property refers to a gene/protein disease association, you could use [SIO:000983
    (gene-disease association)](http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_000983.rdf)
    as the [additionalType](http://schema.org/additionalType) for the additionalProperty.

- property: additionalType
  expected_types:
  - URL
  description: An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific
    types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between
    something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use
    the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org
    tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular those defined
    externally.
  type: ""
  type_url: ""
  bsc_description: Although not required, additionalType can be used to specify the
    nature of the record. For instance, a UniProt protein record would have [UP:Protein](http://www.uniprot.org/core/Protein)
