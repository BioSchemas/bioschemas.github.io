    designed to use specific schema.org properties (e.g. http://schema.org/width,
    http://schema.org/color, http://schema.org/gtin13, ...) will typically expect
    such data to be provided using those properties, rather than using the generic
    property/value mechanism.'

  bsc_description: As much a possible, do not use it! Alternatively, consider reusing
    properties/relations already coined in controlled vocabularies. We recommed to
    look at the [OBO Relations Ontology (RO)](http://obofoundry.org/ontology/ro.html)
    or the [Semanticscience Integrated Ontology (SIO)](http://sio.semanticscience.org/)
    as starting points.

  description: An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific
    types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between
    something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use
    the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org
    tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular those defined
    externally.

    The location can refer to a position in the chromosome or sequence or to a physical place where, for instance, a sample is stored.

For instance, [FALDO](https://github.com/OBF/FALDO) can be used for sequence co-ordinates.
