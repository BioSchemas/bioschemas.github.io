  description: |-
    A technique or technology used in a Dataset (or DataDownload, DataCatalog), corresponding to the method used for measuring the corresponding variable(s) (described using [variableMeasured](http://pending.schema.org/variableMeasured)). This is oriented towards scientific and scholarly dataset publication but may have broader applicability; it is not intended as a full representation of measurement, but rather as a high level summary for dataset discovery.
    For example, if variableMeasured is: molecule concentration, measurementTechnique could be: "mass spectrometry" or "nmr spectroscopy" or "colorimetry" or "immunofluorescence".
    If the variableMeasured is "depression rating", the measurementTechnique could be "Zung Scale" or "HAM-D" or "Beck Depression Inventory".
    If there are several variableMeasured properties recorded for some given data object, use a PropertyValuefor each variableMeasured and attach the corresponding measurementTechnique.
