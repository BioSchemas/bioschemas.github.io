  description: |-
    A property-value pair representing an additional characteristics of the entitity, e.g. a product feature or another characteristic for which there is no matching property in schema.org.

    Note: Publishers should be aware that applications designed to use specific schema.org properties (e.g. http://schema.org/width, http://schema.org/color, http://schema.org/gtin13, ...) will typically expect such data to be provided using those properties, rather than using the generic property/value mechanism.
  type: ""

  bsc_description: |-
    Whenever possible, please use a property coined in a third-party well-know vocabulary. For instance, you can directly use [RO ObjectProperty: enables](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002327) as a property to express how a protein or gene enables some GO molecular function. If you still want or need to use additionalProperty, please use (i) property name to specify the name of the property, (ii) additionalType (if possible) to better specify the nature of the property, and (iii) value to link to the object/range of this property. We recommed to look at the [OBO Relations Ontology (RO)](http://obofoundry.org/ontology/ro.html) or the [Semanticscience Integrated Ontology (SIO)](http://sio.semanticscience.org/) as starting points.

    **Bioschemas Protein**: If no suitable property exists in this profile, use any ontology term coined as a property and suitable for your needs. For instance [sio:SIO_000095](http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_000095) (is member of) could be used to model the relation between a protein and a protein clan.
