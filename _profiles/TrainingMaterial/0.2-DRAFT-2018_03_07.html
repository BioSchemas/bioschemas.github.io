  subtitle: 'A specification for describing training materials in life sciences.'
  description: 'The Life Science Training Materials specification provides a way to describe
    bioscience training material on the World Wide Web. It defines a set of metadata
    and vocabularies, built on top of existing technologies and standards, that can
    be used to represent events in Web pages and applications. The goal of the specification
    is to make it easier to discover, exchange and integrate life science training material
    information across the Internet.'
