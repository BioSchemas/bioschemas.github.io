  title: TrainingMaterial
  subtitle: A specification for describing training materials in life sciences.
  description: 'The Life Science Training Materials specification provides a way to
    describe bioscience training material on the World Wide Web. It defines a set
    of metadata and vocabularies, built on top of existing technologies and standards,
    that can be used to represent events in Web pages and applications. The goal of
    the specification is to make it easier to discover, exchange and integrate life
    science training material information across the Internet.<h4>Summary of Changes</h4>
    Changes since previous draft 0.8 of the TrainingMaterials profile:
    <ul>
      <li>Updates range for keywords and learningResource to reflect changes on schema.org</li>
      <li>Changes keywords to MANY as comma separation is not enough for DefinedTerm or URL (they need a list/array)</li>
      <li>Changes prepared by L. Garcia</li>
    </ul>'
