  - Organization

  description: A maintainer of a [Dataset](https://schema.org/Dataset), software package
    ([SoftwareApplication](https://schema.org/SoftwareApplication)), or other [Project](https://schema.org/Project).
    A maintainer is a [Person](https://schema.org/Person) or [Organization](https://schema.org/Organization)
    that manages contributions to, and/or publication of, some (typically complex)
    artifact. It is common for distributions of software and data to be based on "upstream"
    sources. When [maintainer](https://schema.org/maintainer) is applied to a specific
    version of something e.g. a particular version or packaging of a [Dataset](https://schema.org/Dataset),
    it is always possible that the upstream source has a different maintainer. The
    [isBasedOn](https://schema.org/isBasedOn) property can be used to indicate such
    relationships between datasets to make the different maintenance roles clear.
    Similarly in the case of software, a package may have dedicated maintainers working
    on integration into software distributions such as Ubuntu, as well as upstream
    maintainers of the underlying work.

    A technique or technology used in a [Dataset](https://schema.org/Dataset) (or [DataDownload](https://schema.org/DataDownload), [DataCatalog](https://schema.org/DataCatalog)), corresponding to the method used for measuring the corresponding variable(s) (described using [variableMeasured](https://schema.org/variableMeasured)). This is oriented towards scientific and scholarly dataset publication but may have broader applicability; it is not intended as a full representation of measurement, but rather as a high level summary for dataset discovery.

    For example, if [variableMeasured](https://schema.org/variableMeasured) is: molecule concentration, [measurementTechnique](https://schema.org/measurementTechnique) could be: "mass spectrometry" or "nmr spectroscopy" or "colorimetry" or "immunofluorescence".

    If the [variableMeasured](https://schema.org/variableMeasured) is "depression rating", the [measurementTechnique](https://schema.org/measurementTechnique) could be "Zung Scale" or "HAM-D" or "Beck Depression Inventory".

    If there are several [variableMeasured](https://schema.org/variableMeasured) properties recorded for some given data object, use a [PropertyValue](https://schema.org/PropertyValue) for each [variableMeasured](https://schema.org/variableMeasured) and attach the corresponding [measurementTechnique](https://schema.org/measurementTechnique).
