  subtitle: Bioschemas specification for describing a workflow in the Life Sciences
  description: A workflow consists of an orchestrated and repeatable pattern of activity
    enabled by the systematic organization of resources into processes that transform
    materials, provide services, or process information. It can be depicted as a sequence
    of operations, the work of a person or group, the work of an organization of staff,
    or one or more simple or complex mechanisms. (source Wikipedia.org)

    Unregistered or niche encoding and file formats can be indicated instead via the most appropriate URL, e.g. defining Web page or a Wikipedia/Wikidata entry. Supersedes fileFormat.
