  subtitle: Bioschemas specification for describing a Computational Workflow
  description: A computational workflow consists of an orchestrated and repeatable
    pattern of activity enabled by the systematic organization of resources into processes
    that transform materials, provide services, or process information (source Wikipedia.org).
    It is executed by a computational process and is thus distinct from laboratory
    or business workflows.

- property: maintainer
  expected_types:

  description: A maintainer of a Dataset, software package (SoftwareApplication),
    or other Project. A maintainer is a Person or Organization that manages contributions
    to, and/or publication of, some (typically complex) artifact. It is common for
    distributions of software and data to be based on "upstream" sources. When maintainer
    is applied to a specific version of something e.g. a particular version or packaging
    of a Dataset, it is always possible that the upstream source has a different maintainer.
    The isBasedOn property can be used to indicate such relationships between datasets
    to make the different maintenance roles clear. Similarly in the case of software,
    a package may have dedicated maintainers working on integration into software
    distributions such as Ubuntu, as well as upstream maintainers of the underlying
    work.
