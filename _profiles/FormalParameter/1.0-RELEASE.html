  description: An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific
    types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between
    something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use
    the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org
    tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular those defined
    externally.

    The type of data consumed / produced at the FormalParameter.

    It is strongly recommented that this be specified. If it is not specified, then nothing should be assumed about the type of the FormalParameter.

    Media type typically expressed using a MIME format (see IANA site and MDN reference) e.g. application/zip for a SoftwareApplication binary, audio/mpeg for .mp3 etc.).

    In cases where a CreativeWork has several media type representations, encoding can be used to indicate each MediaObject alongside particular encodingFormat information.

    Unregistered or niche encoding and file formats can be indicated instead via the most appropriate URL, e.g. defining Web page or a Wikipedia/Wikidata entry.

  description: The identifier property represents any kind of identifier for any kind
    of Thing, such as ISBNs, GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated

    (URI) links. See background notes for more details.

    Note that this is identification of what is produced / consumed by the FormalParameter.

    The identifier may, for example, indicate a gene position that is expected to be read. The value supplied as the actual value will be read from that position.
