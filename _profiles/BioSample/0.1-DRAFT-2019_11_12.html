  title: BioSample
  subtitle: A bioschema's profile describing a biological sample.
  description: 'A biological material entity that is representative of a whole. Comments:
    Typically samples are intended to be representative of the whole or aspects thereof.
    Examples of samples include biomedical samples (blood, urine) and plant specimens
    held at herbaria.'

  description: |-
    A property-value pair representing an additional characteristics of the entitity, e.g. a product feature or another characteristic for which there is no matching property in schema.org.
    Note: Publishers should be aware that applications designed to use specific schema.org properties (e.g. http://schema.org/width, http://schema.org/color, http://schema.org/gtin13, ...) will typically expect such data to be provided using those properties, rather than using the generic property/value mechanism.
