  description: |-
    A property-value pair representing an additional characteristics of the entitity, e.g. a product feature or another characteristic for which there is no matching property in schema.org.

    Note: Publishers should be aware that applications designed to use specific schema.org properties (e.g. http://schema.org/width, http://schema.org/color, http://schema.org/gtin13, ...) will typically expect such data to be provided using those properties, rather than using the generic property/value mechanism.
  type: ""

  bsc_description: Before using this property, make sure none of the existing ones
    covers your case. Whenever possible, please use a property coined in a third-party
    well-know vocabulary. Please always use (i) property name to specify the name
    of the property, (ii) additionalType (if possible) to better specify the nature
    of the property (e.g., link to the third-party well-known vocabulary term), and
    (iii) value to link to the object/range of this property.
