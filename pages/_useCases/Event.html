<p>Conferences, workshops, meetings and events in general play a very important role in knowledge sharing
and acquisition of new skills. Though there are several technological solutions for event sharing, events
in life sciences are still not described in a consistent manner that would make them easy to discover, exchange or compare.</p>
<p>Because there is no single standard to follow, the dissemination, discovery and aggregation of events is not effective. As a result,
the advertisement of an event in third party websites normally requires manual curation to shape the content to each providerâ€™s requirements.</p>
