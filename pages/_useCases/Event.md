Conferences, workshops, meetings and events in general play a very important role in knowledge sharing and acquisition of new skills. Though there are several technological solutions for event sharing, events in life sciences are still not described in a consistent manner that would make them easy to discover, exchange or compare.

Because there is no single standard to follow, the dissemination, discovery and aggregation of events is not effective. As a result, the advertisement of an event in third party websites normally requires manual curation to shape the content to each providerâ€™s requirements.
