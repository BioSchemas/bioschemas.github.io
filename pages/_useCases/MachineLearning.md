### Findability

* As a user, I would like to search for training datasets according to, e.g., :
  * the area they serve (example: protein-protein interaction)
  * the underlying data type they compile (example: patient data, butterfly wings)
  * the application supported (example: binary classification)
* As a user, I would like to search for models ready to be used (search criteria will be similar to the dataset described above)

### Rich dataset description

As a user, I would like to get enough information on a training dataset for me to quickly judge if it would work for my own research, for instance, I want information about license, classes supported and distribution of the data points (if it is meant for classification), features supported.

### Overall process description

As a user, I would like to get a quick picture of how the training was done, optimized and evaluated.
