The overall aim is findability and not structured queries. Based on this, the key use cases that have driven the selection of the fields are the following:

1.  Search on a title of dataset
2.  Enable discovery by indexing on free text description
3.  Enable direct access, resolution of dataset
4.  Allow restriction to specific dimensions and variables specifically recorded in a dataset (e.g. get all climate datasets which have monitors CO2 concentration or datasets where metabolite concentration was recorded)
5.  Search according to the repository of the datasets
6.  Search according to creator, author
7.  Allow restriction to how a dataset has been generated (e.g. get all climate datasets if metabolite concentration was recorded if acquired using mass spectrometry)
