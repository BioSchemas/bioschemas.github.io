### Objectives


- Develop the metadata markup to find and register a workflow in a registry and exchange metadata between workflow registries
- Advocate for the adoption of the markup in workflow registries and repositories
- Advocate for the adoption of the markup by workflow management systems
- Advocate for the development of tools to support the markup and its use


### Use Cases

There are a large number of computational workflow formats and systems. In the absence of common metadata, it is impossible to find or compare suitable workflow(s).

The [WorkflowHub](https://workflowhub.eu) allows the registration of diverse workflows, and exposes them through the agreed metadata

The metadata has been developed by [Workflow group](/groups/Workflow). The group includes members from many computational workflow communities, including [Galaxy](https://galaxyproject.org/), [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/), [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io) and [Scipion](https://scipion-em.github.io/docs/).
