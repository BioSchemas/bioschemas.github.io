During the meeting we'll be giving an update on Bioschemas followed by a discussion session where we will look at the following questions facing the Bioschemas Global Community:
- How does Bioschemas engage with data resource operators?
- How does Bioschemas engage with service-provider users (markup developer/markup consumer)?
- Assessment of Bioschemas Community Manager Role - has this worked?
- Documenting Bioschemas impact
