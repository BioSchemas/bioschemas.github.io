Bioschemas will be presenting on the joint work with [Open AIRE](https://www.openaire.eu/) and [FAIRsharing](https://fairsharing.org/). We have been exploring how to exploit Bioschemas markup embedded in web pages to populate the Open AIRE Research Knowledge Graph. We have initially focused on [Protein profile](https://bioschemas.org/profiles/Protein) markup, and extended the Open AIRE Research Knowledge Graph data model to include protein data. We have also tested the infrastructure needed to harvest data at scale from a number of sites and transform the data into the knowledge graph model.
