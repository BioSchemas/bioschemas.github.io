Our Monthly Bioschemas call alternates between 'technical' meetings, targeting developers, and 'community' calls for general discussions and tips for using Bioschemas. 

Our next meeting will be a **technical meeting on 2025.10.20 at 17:00 CEST** (yes, still CEST despite Europe getting cold and dark). We will discuss subjects related to the web page, tutorials, and so. Meeting time in your own time zone [here](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Bioschemas&iso=20251020T15)

The next community meeting will be in 2025.11.17 at 17:00 CET (please notice the change of time zone), invited talk to be announced. 

Please do join us and add details to your calendar so you do not miss it!
