Ontologies are a holistic approach to semantically describe data, information and knowledge of a domain. They provide terms, relations and logic to semantically annotate and link data building knowledge graphs. The application of standard taxonomies and vocabularies from the very beginning of data generation and along research workflows in electronic lab notebooks (ELNs), software tools, and their final publication in data repositories create FAIR data straightforwardly. In Biology, Chemistry and related sciences  quite a few chemical already exist to describe the molecules, their characteristics and reactions.

During this workshop we aim to bring together creators, curators and users of chemical ontologies to discuss their application in research data annotations and a general roadmap for joint efforts on future developments. Further topics will include latest developments on tools to work with ontologies, the provision of ontologies with terminology services and their integration in other services/software.
