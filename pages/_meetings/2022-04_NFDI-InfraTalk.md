**Title:** (Bio)schemas – Making (not only life science) data resources more interoperable and discoverable on the Web

**Date:** 4 April 2022 @ 15:00 (BST)

**Abstract:** The content of web ressources can be enriched with machine processable metadata using the Schema.org vocabulary. The embedded markup is used by dedicated (metadata) search portals such as Google's Dataset Search, but also as general mechanism for Search engine optimization (SEO) and to display rich information snippets to users.

The Bioschemas community aims to build on these approaches to enable life sciences resources to become more discoverable on the Web. The community has developed Schema.org terms for describing life sciences related concepts, and provides usage guides and tools to help with the development.

Bioschemas markup can also be exploited by our own communities. The ELIXIR Training Portal (TeSS) already harvests Bioschemas markup to populate their registry, and we have been working with different ELIXIR communities to generate community specific Knowledge Graphs over their resources. Another benefit is that the same markup can be used to feed content into general research knowledge graphs such as OpenAIRE.

In this talk, we will give an overview of Bioschemas and show how the markup can be consumed by others. imported into a triplestore, and exposed as a REST API.
