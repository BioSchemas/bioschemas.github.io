**Title:** Bioschemas – Making life sciences resources more discoverable on the Web

**Date:** 4 April 2022 @ 15:00 (BST)

**Abstract:** Search engine optimization (SEO) is an approach that embeds machine processable metadata using the Schema.org vocabulary into web pages. The markup is used by search engines to better understand the content of pages, enabling them to provide improved search results and a richer search experience through rich snippets. It is also used to provide dedicate search portals such as Google's Dataset Search.

The Bioschemas community aim to build on these approaches to enable life sciences resource to become more discoverable on the Web. The community have developed Schema.org terms for describing life sciences resources, and provide usage guides and tools to help with the development.

Bioschemas markup can also be exploited by our own communities. The ELIXIR Training Portal (TeSS) already harvests Bioschemas markup to populate their registry. More recently, we have been working with the Intrinsically Disordered Protein (IDP) community in ELIXIR to generate the IDP Knowledge Graph containing data about IDPs from three leading resources. We are now scaling this approach too many more sources. Another benefit is that the same markup can be used to feed content into general research knowledge graphs such as OpenAIRE.

In this talk, we will give an overview of Bioschemas and show how the markup can be consumed by others.
