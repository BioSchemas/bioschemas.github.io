The [ELIXIR Interoperability Platform](https://elixir-europe.org/platforms/interoperability) are using their 2020 Face-to-Face meeting to hold a 2-day virtual hackathon to respond to the Covid-19 crisis. Bioschemas is the focus of Track 2:

> AIM | Extend the previous work on data resources beyond Dataset and DataCatalog markup. For data discoverability that can aid the research of infectious diseases such as COVID-19, the dataset needs to be marked up so that they can be queried by protein-related information. This track is proposed to do a drill-down on marking up resources by Bioschemas [Gene](/profiles/Gene), [Protein](/profiles/Protein), and [MolecularEntity](/profiles/MolecularEntity) profiles.

We will be working with the following communities and resources
- [Intrinsically Disordered Proteins](https://elixir-europe.org/communities/intrinsically-disordered-proteins)
- [Rare Diseases](https://elixir-europe.org/communities/rare-diseases)
- [UniProt](https://uniprot.org)
- [InterMine](https://intermine.org/)
