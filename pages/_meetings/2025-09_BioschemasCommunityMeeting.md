Our Monthly Bioschemas call alternates between 'technical' meetings, targeting developers, and 'community' calls for general discussions and tips for using Bioschemas. 

**Community meetings occur on odd months, next meeting on 2025.09.15**. Technical ones every even month, next one in August but likely to be postponed to September. 

Please do join us and add details to your calendar so you do not miss it!

Please notice that we are entering into the summer break so no meeting on July or August 2025. Happy summer break! (winter for those in a different hemisphere :-)
