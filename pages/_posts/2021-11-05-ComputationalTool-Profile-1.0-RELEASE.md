We are pleased to announce the release of the [ComputationalTool Profile](/profiles/ComputationalTool/1.0-RELEASE) from the [Tools Working Group](/groups/Tools/).

All the record pages in the [bio.tools](https://bio.tools) registry are published with ComputationalTool profile compliant markup. In addition, bioschemas markup can be generated on demand through an API (https://bio.tools/api/bwa?format=jsonld). 

This profile has been aligned with the [ComputationalWorkflow Profile](/profiles/ComputationalWorkflow/1.0-RELEASE). The [FormalParameter](/types/FormalParameter/1.0-RELEASE) type to richly annotate inputs and outputs thanks to the [EDAM](https://edamontology.org) ontology.
