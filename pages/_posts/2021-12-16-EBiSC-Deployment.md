Building on the [earlier work](/posts/2021-06-30-EBISC-Deployment) to add markup into The Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Registry ([hPSCreg](https://hpscreg.eu/)), the team have now deployed [BioSample](/profiles/BioSample) markup in the European Bank for Induced pluripotent Stem Cells ([EBiSC registry](https://ebisc.org/)).

The development work was conducted as part of the EU IMI [FAIRplus project](https://fairplus-project.eu/) with the goal of making the registry more Findable on the Web. Future activities will look at consuming the markup in collaboration with the work on [Rare Diseases](/news/tags.html#disease).
