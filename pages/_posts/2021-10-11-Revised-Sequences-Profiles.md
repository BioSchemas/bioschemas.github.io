The following profiles have been updated to allow the linking of sequence annotations to genes and proteins:
- [Gene 1.0-RELEASE](https://bioschemas.org/profiles/Gene/1.0-RELEASE) --> [Gene 1.1-DRAFT](https://bioschemas.org/profiles/Gene/1.1-DRAFT) – adds a property to connect a gene to a SequenceAnnotation
- [Protein 0.11-RELEASE](https://bioschemas.org/profiles/Protein/0.11-RELEASE) --> [Protein 0.12-DRAFT](https://bioschemas.org/profiles/Protein/0.12-DRAFT) – adds a property to connect a protein to a SequenceAnnotation
- [ProteinAnnotation 0.6-DRAFT](https://bioschemas.org/profiles/ProteinAnnotation/0.6-DRAFT) --> [SequenceAnnotation 0.7-DRAFT](https://bioschemas.org/profiles/SequenceAnnotation/0.7-DRAFT) – note that this deprecates the ProteinAnnotation profile; generalising it to SequenceAnnotation
- Adds the [SequenceRange 0.1-DRAFT](ttps://bioschemas.org/profiles/SequenceRange/0.1-DRAFT) profile
