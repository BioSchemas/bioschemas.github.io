At [SWAT4HCLS 2022](https://www.swat4ls.org/workshops/leiden2022/) we will be giving a [tutorial on deploying and harvesting Bioschemas markup](/meetings/2022-01_SWAT4HCLS_leiden).

We have also had a paper accepted on the construction of the [Intrinsically Disordered Protein Knowledge Graph](https://alasdairgray.github.io/IDP-KG/), which is generated from Bioschemas markup harvested from the Web.
