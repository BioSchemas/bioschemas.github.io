  description: 'A specification for describing training materials in life sciences.
    The Life Science Training Materials specification provides a way to describe bioscience
    training material on the World Wide Web. It defines a set of metadata and vocabularies,
    built on top of existing technologies and standards, that can be used to represent
    events in Web pages and applications. The goal of the specification is to make
    it easier to discover, exchange and integrate life science training material information
    across the Internet.<h4>Summary of Changes</h4>    Changes since previous draft
