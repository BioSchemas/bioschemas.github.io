  description: Journals are commonly identified by their issn. We recommend to use
    here the form namespace:id. For instance, issn:2041-1480.  The identifier property
    represents any kind of identifier for any kind of Thing, such as ISBNs, GTIN codes,
    UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for representing many of these,
    either as textual strings or as URL (URI) links. See [background notes](http://schema.org/docs/datamodel.html#identifierBg)
    for more details.
