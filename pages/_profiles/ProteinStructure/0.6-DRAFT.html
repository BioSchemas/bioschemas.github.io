  description: 'As much a possible, do not use it! Alternatively, consider reusing
    properties/relations already coined in controlled vocabularies. We recommed to
    look at the [OBO Relations Ontology (RO)](http://obofoundry.org/ontology/ro.html)
    or the [Semanticscience Integrated Ontology (SIO)](http://sio.semanticscience.org/)
    as starting points. A property-value pair representing an additional characteristics
    of the entitity, e.g. a product feature or another characteristic for which there
    is no matching property in schema.org. Note: Publishers should be aware that applications
    designed to use specific schema.org properties (e.g. http://schema.org/width,
    http://schema.org/color, http://schema.org/gtin13, ...) will typically expect
    such data to be provided using those properties, rather than using the generic
    property/value mechanism.'

  description: Should be set to any of the values listed in the Controlled Vocabulary.
    An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types
    from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between
    something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use
    the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org
    tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular those defined
    externally.
