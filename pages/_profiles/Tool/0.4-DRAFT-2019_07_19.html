  subtitle: Bioschemas specification for describing a SoftwareApplication in the Life
    Sciences
  description: The Life Science Tools specification provides a way to describe bioscience
    tools and software on the World Wide Web. It defines a set of metadata and vocabularies,
    built on top of existing technologies and standards, that can be used to represent
    such tools in Web pages and applications. The goal of the specification is to
    make it easier to discover, exchange and integrate information about life science
    tools across the Internet.

  expected_types:
  - Text
  description: An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific
    types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between
    something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use
    the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org
    tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular those defined
    externally.
