spec_info:
  description: Protein is here used in its widest possible definition, as classes
    of amino acid based molecules. Amyloid-beta Protein in human (UniProt P05067),
    eukaryota (e.g. an OrthoDB group) or even a single molecule that one can point
    to are all of type schema:Protein. A protein can thus be a subclass of another
    protein, e.g. schema:Protein as a UniProt record can have multiple isoforms inside
    it which would also be schema:Protein. They can be imagined, synthetic, hypothetical
    or naturally occurring. This version has been added to schema.org as a pending
    type.
