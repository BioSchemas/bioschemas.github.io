  description: Publication issues do not commonly have a global or unique identifier.
    We recommend here to use the URL as identifier whenever possible. The identifier
    property represents any kind of identifier for any kind of Thing, such as ISBNs,
    GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for representing
    many of these, either as textual strings or as URL (URI) links. See [background
    notes](http://schema.org/docs/datamodel.html#identifierBg) for more details.
