  description: 'Before using this property, make sure none of the existing ones covers
    your case. Whenever possible, please use a property coined in a third-party well-know
    vocabulary. Please always use (i) property name to specify the name of the property,
    (ii) additionalType (if possible) to better specify the nature of the property
    (e.g., link to the third-party well-known vocabulary term), and (iii) value to
    link to the object/range of this property. A property-value pair representing
    an additional characteristics of the entitity, e.g. a product feature or another
