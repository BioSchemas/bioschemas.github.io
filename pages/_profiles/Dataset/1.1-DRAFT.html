  description: ' A technique or technology used in a [Dataset](https://schema.org/Dataset)

    corresponding to the method used for measuring the corresponding variable(s) (described
    using [variableMeasured](https://schema.org/variableMeasured)). This is oriented
    towards scientific and scholarly dataset publication but may have broader applicability;
    it is not intended as a full representation of measurement, but rather as a high
    level summary for dataset discovery.


    For example, if [variableMeasured](https://schema.org/variableMeasured) is: molecule
    concentration, [measurementTechnique](https://schema.org/measurementTechnique)
    could be: "mass spectrometry" or "nmr spectroscopy" or "colorimetry" or "immunofluorescence".


    If the [variableMeasured](https://schema.org/variableMeasured) is "depression
    rating", the [measurementTechnique](https://schema.org/measurementTechnique) could
    be "Zung Scale" or "HAM-D" or "Beck Depression Inventory".


    If there are several [variableMeasured](https://schema.org/variableMeasured) properties
    recorded for some given data object, use a [PropertyValue](https://schema.org/PropertyValue)
    for each [variableMeasured](https://schema.org/variableMeasured) and attach the
    corresponding [measurementTechnique](https://schema.org/measurementTechnique).'

  description: ' A maintainer of a [Dataset](https://schema.org/Dataset), software

    or [Organization](https://schema.org/Organization) that manages contributions
    to, and/or publication of, some (typically complex) artifact. It is common for
    distributions of software and data to be based on "upstream" sources. When [maintainer](https://schema.org/maintainer)
    is applied to a specific version of something e.g. a particular version or packaging
    of a [Dataset](https://schema.org/Dataset), it is always possible that the upstream
    source has a different maintainer. The [isBasedOn](https://schema.org/isBasedOn)
    property can be used to indicate such relationships between datasets to make the
    different maintenance roles clear. Similarly in the case of software, a package
    may have dedicated maintainers working on integration into software distributions
    such as Ubuntu, as well as upstream maintainers of the underlying work.'
