  description: 'An equivalent TaxonName type from a well known vocabulary, e.g. TDWG:
    http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/TaxonName#TaxonName An additional type for the
    item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies
    in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that
    the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use the native RDFa syntax -
    the ''typeof'' attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org tools may have only
    weaker understanding of extra types, in particular those defined externally.'
