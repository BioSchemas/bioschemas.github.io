    **Note:** Bioschemas have changed [URL](http://schema.org/URL) to [Text](http://schema.org/Text)
    in the Expected Types. This will be reverted once Bio.Tools provides stable URIs
    for tool types. An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more
    specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship
    between something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better
    to use the native RDFa syntax - the ''typeof'' attribute - for multiple types.
    Schema.org tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular
    those defined externally.'

  description: ' specification for describing a  in the Life Sciences The Life Science
    Tools specification provides a way to describe bioscience tools and software on
    the World Wide Web. It defines a set of metadata and vocabularies, built on top
    of existing technologies and standards, that can be used to represent such tools
    in Web pages and applications. The goal of the specification is to make it easier
    to discover, exchange and integrate information about life science tools across
    the Internet. <h3>Summary of Changes</h3> <p>Changes since the 0.4-DRAFT of the
    tools profile:</p> <ul> <li>Profile name changed from Tool to ComputationalTool</li>
