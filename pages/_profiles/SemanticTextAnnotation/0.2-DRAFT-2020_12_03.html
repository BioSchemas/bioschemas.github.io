  title: SemanticTextAnnotation
  subtitle: Bioschemas profile, based on Biotea model, describing a semantic annotation
    associated to a piece of text in a ScholarlyArticle in Life Sciences.
  description: 'A SemanticTextAnnotation corresponds to an expression identified in
    a ScholarlyArticle and associated to an ontology term.<h4>Summary of Changes</h4>    Changes
    since previous draft 0.1 of the SemanticAnnotation profile:    <ul>      <li>Add
    examples</li>      <li>Updates name to SemanticTextAnnotation as currently only
    text-based annotations are supported, if needd a supperclass SemanticAnnotation
    can be created and then add support to, for instance, images or so</li>      <li>Changes
    commentCount to optional as sometimes calculation is also possible</li>      <li>Changes
    creator and dates to optional as they can also be provided at container/dataset
    level only</li>      <li>Adds datePublished as optional</li>      <li>Removes
    isAccessibleForFree and license (most likely to be found at container/dataset
    level)</li>      <li>Adds isPartOf as optional to link to the dataset or collection
    containing this annotation</li>      <li>Double checks the property range as some
    has been updated in schema.org</li>      <li>Changes prepared by L. Garcia</li>    </ul>'
