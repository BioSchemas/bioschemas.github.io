  subtitle: A specification for describing people in life sciences
  description: The Life Science Person specification provides a way to describe bioscience
    events on the World Wide Web. It defines a set of metadata and vocabularies, built
    on top of existing technologies and standards, that can be used to represent the
    profile information of people in Web pages and applications. The goal of the specification
    is to make it easier to discover, life science profile information.
