spec_info:
  description: A computational workflow consists of an orchestrated and repeatable
    pattern of activity enabled by the systematic organization of resources into processes
    that transform materials, provide services, or process information (source Wikipedia.org).
    It is executed by a computational process and is thus distinct from laboratory
    or business workflows. version 1.0-RELEASE
