  description: " maintainer of a Dataset, software package (SoftwareApplication),\

    \ distributions of software and data to be based on \u201Cupstream\u201D sources.\
    \ When maintainer is applied to a specific version of something e.g. a particular\
    \ version or packaging of a Dataset, it is always possible that the upstream source\
    \ has a different maintainer. The isBasedOn property can be used to indicate such\
    \ relationships between datasets to make the different maintenance roles clear.\
    \ Similarly in the case of software, a package may have dedicated maintainers\
    \ working on integration into software distributions such as Ubuntu, as well as\
    \ upstream maintainers of the underlying work."
