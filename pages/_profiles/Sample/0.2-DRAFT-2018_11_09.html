spec_info:
  description: "To deliver on the identified use cases for samples, we have identified\
    \ a minimal set of properties to encapsulate identification, linking, and metadata\
    \ descriptions. Some of these properties are existing standard schema.org properties,\
    \ others require Bioschemas extensions. Table 1 outlines the minimal set of properties\
    \ for the \u2018Sample\u2019 concept and Table 2 shows our recommendations for\
    \ use of the \u2018PropertyValue\u2019 concept to markup additional characteristics\
    \ of a sample described within a sample page. We also propose a new concept, \u2018\
    Biomedical Code\u2019, which is a generalisation of the existing \u2018Medical\
    \ Code\u2019 concept defined in the health-lifesci.schema.org extension."
