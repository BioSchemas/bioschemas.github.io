    (e.g., "@id" in JSON-LD)<h4>Summary of Changes</h4>    Changes since previous
    draft 0.1 of the ScholarlyArticle profile:    <ul>      <li>Add examples</li>      <li>Updates
    identifier property to MANY so multiple identifiers can be included</li>      <li>Uses
    name for the title (as per schema.org examples) and keeps headline (optional)
    for compatibility purposes</li>      <li>Simplifies the profile by removing alternateName
    and alternativeHeadline as they are not commonly used</li>      <li>Changes sameAs
    so it is used only for machine-readable representations</li>      <li>Changes
    url so it is used for any (MANY) web page displaying this article</li>      <li>Changes
    about to link to SemanticTextAnnotation (rather than SemanticAnnotation as only
    those based on text are currently supported)</li>      <li>Uses abstract rather
    than backstory to store the article abstract</li>      <li>Simplifies the profile
    by removing copyrightHolder and copyrightYear are they are not commonly used</li>      <li>Adds
    correction so it is possible to link to corrections of this article</li>      <li>Adds
    editor and funder</li>      <li>Changes isAccessibleForFree to optional as license
    is more common and has more information</li>      <li>Changes isBasedOn to optional
    as it is not that common</li>      <li>Changes keywords to MANY as DefinedTerm
    and URL would require them to be separated in a list rather by only commas</li>      <li>Adds
    publisher as recommended (mandatory for Google Structured Data)</li>      <li>Removes
    version</li>      <li>Removes article section as it referes to sports, culture

    wordCount as not that common</li>      <li>Double checks the property range as

    if needed.
