    <h3>Summary of changes</h3>

    Changes since previous draft 0.7 of the LabProtocols profile:

    <ul>

    <li>Uses LabProtocol draft type 0.5</li>

    <li>Uses name for the name/title of the protocol rather than headline</li>

    <li>Uses intendedUse for the purpose of the protocol</li>

    <li>Moves isPartOf to optional as it is rather generic</li>

    <li>Uses computationalTool rather than sotwareUsed</li>

    </ul>'
