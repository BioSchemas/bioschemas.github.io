  description: 'This LabProtocol profile specification presents the markup for describing
    a LabProtocol.<h4>Summary of Changes</h4>    Changes since previous draft of the
    LabProtocols profile:    <ul>      <li>''used'' added at the end to elements used
    in the protocol, see <a href=''https://github.com/Bioschemas/specifications/issues/265''>issue
    265</a></li>      <li>Protocols advantages, limitations, outcomes, purpose and
    application were mixed up in the previous draft, they have been revised.</li>      <li>Short
    examples have been added per properties, see <a href=''https://github.com/Bioschemas/specifications/issues/179''>issue
    179</a>.</li>      <li>Links to the ontologies were revised.</li>      <li>Property
