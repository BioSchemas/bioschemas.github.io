<h1>Bioschemas Types and Properties Development</h1>

<p>For the purposes of the [Bioschemas Face to Face Meeting](meetings/2019-05_BioschemasFace2Face/) on 8 May 2019, we made a cache copy of the proposed schema.org extensions. The extension continues to be developed and we cannot sustain the effort required to maintain this cache copy.</p>

<p>Interested parties should look at the latest proposals at <a href="http://bio.sdo-bioschemas-227516.appspot.com/">http://bio.sdo-bioschemas-227516.appspot.com/</a>. Please note that there is a quota limit placed on us. We apologise in advance if we have already met our quota for the day.</p>
