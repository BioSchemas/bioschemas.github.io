The ELIXIR Research Data Management Kit ([RDMkit](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/)) is an online guide containing good data management practices applicable to research projects from the beginning to the end. Developed and managed by people who work every day with life science data, the RDMkit has guidelines, information, and pointers to help you with problems throughout the dataâ€™s life cycle.

By marking up the pages with `Person` profiles, the RDMkit wants to give their contributors the recognition they deserve.
