[Bgee](https://bgee.org/), the gene expression data in animals database, has deployed the [Gene profile](/profiles/Gene) on over 750,000 pages across 30 species. This will soon go up to 52 species with an increase in the number of pages containing markup. The pages have been indexed in a sitemap to enable the harvesting of data.

Keep an eye out for the outcomes of the BioHackathon 2021 to see what we've done with a sample of the data.
