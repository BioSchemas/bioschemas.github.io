We are pleased to announce the latest release of FAIR-Checker, a FAIR automated assessment tool, available at [https://fair-checker.france-bioinformatique.fr](https://fair-checker.france-bioinformatique.fr)

FAIR-Checker can be used to evaluate how web annotated resources conform to Bioschemas profiles using the Inspect option.
The validation strategy is still under development and contributions are welcome at [https://github.com/BioSchemas/bioschemas-validation](https://github.com/BioSchemas/bioschemas-validation)
