The [Galaxy Training Network](https://training.galaxyproject.org/) is a collection of hands-on tutorials that are designed to be interactive and are built around Galaxy.
These tutorials can be used for learning and teaching how to use Galaxy for general data analysis, as well as a wide array of hands-on tutorials covering specific domains such as assembly, RNA-Seq analysis, deep learning, climate analysis, and more!

The GTN has migrated from using the generic Schemas.org [Course Profile](https://schema.org/Course) profile to the [TrainingMaterial](/profiles/TrainingMaterial) profile which has allowed them to annotate their materials much more effectively. The markup also includes the use of the [Person](/profiles/Person) profile, to track the contributions of all of their team members. These profiles now annotate all 260+ tutorials, and 260+ contributor profiles.
