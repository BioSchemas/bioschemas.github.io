The [Training Working Group](https://bioschemas.org/groups/Training) have requested that the community consider the TrainingMaterial profile for release based on the [current 0.9-DRAFT](https://bioschemas.org/profiles/TrainingMaterial/0.9-DRAFT-2020_12_08). The final version is available for [preview](https://alasdairgray.github.io/bioschemas.github.io/).

Please either comment on the [Pull Request](https://github.com/BioSchemas/bioschemas.github.io/pull/) or raise new issues on the [GitHub tracker](https://github.com/BioSchemas/bioschemas/labels/type%3A%20Training%20material). Comments should be submitted by end of 11 April. The working group will respond to all issues raised by the community prior to the Steering Council voting on the acceptance of making the proposal a release version.

Many thanks to Patricia Palagi, Michelle Brazas, Chris Child, and Niall Beard as well as the whole Training Working Group for finalising this profile.
