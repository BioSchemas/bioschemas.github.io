The Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Registry ([hPSCreg](https://hpscreg.eu/)) have made the first deployment of the [BioSample profile](/profiles/BioSample).

The development work was conducted as part of the EU IMI [FAIRplus project](https://fairplus-project.eu/) with the goal of making the registry more Findable on the Web. Future activities will look at consuming the markup.
