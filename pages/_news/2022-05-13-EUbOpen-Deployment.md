The [EUbOPEN Portal](https://gateway.eubopen.org/) is a comprehensive tool that allows searching among an open access chemogenomic library comprising about 5,000 well annotated compounds covering roughly 1,000 different proteins. The compound pages have been annotated with Bioschemas [MolecularEntity](https://bioschemas.org/profiles/MolecularEntity/0.5-RELEASE) markup.

The development work was conducted as part of the EU IMI [EUbOPEN project](https://www.eubopen.org/) which aims to enable and unlock biology in the open. The project has 22 partners from academia and industry.
