We are pleased to announce that the Bioschemas community have had three projects accepted at this year's [BioHackathon-Europe event](https://biohackathon-europe.org/) beginning 30th October.

The projects are:
- [Bioschemas resource index for chem and plants](https://github.com/elixir-europe/biohackathon-projects-2023/tree/main/7)
- [Enabling FAIR Digital Objects with RO-Crates, Signposting and Bioschemas](https://github.com/elixir-europe/biohackathon-projects-2023/tree/main/15)
- [Improving Bioschemas creation and community adoption through process improvements and tool development, and advancing compliance to FAIR standards](https://github.com/elixir-europe/biohackathon-projects-2023/tree/main/23)

These projects should give us the opportunity to engage with the wider community, target specific domains, as well as improving our tooling for users.

Please come and join - virtual participation is highly encouraged!
