The [Training Working Group](/groups/Training) are finalising the [TrainingMaterial Profile](/profiles/TrainingMaterial) and have added three live deployments of the profile. The first is for a lecture series on [Biomedical semantics, information retrieval and knowledge discovery](https://zbmed-semtec.github.io/BioMedSem-IR-KD/). The second is for a [collection of tutorials on eNanoMapper](https://enanomapper.github.io/tutorials/). The third is for the training materials associated with a workshop on [NanoSafety and the Semantic Web](https://nanocommons.github.io/workshops/2021-12-08/).
