The [FAIR Cookbook](https://faircookbook.elixir-europe.org/content/home.html) is an online resource for the Life Sciences with recipes that help you to make and keep data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR). In keeping with this aim, the Cookbook itself has embedded markup which complies with the Bioschemas [TrainingMaterial profile](https://bioschemas.org/profiles/TrainingMaterial/).

The development work was conducted as part of the EU IMI [FAIRplus project](https://fairplus-project.eu/) which aims to develop tools and guidelines for making life science data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). The project has 21 partners from academia and industry, and runs from January 2019 to December 2022.
