We are pleased to announce the long-awaited release of the [Course](/profiles/Course/1.0-RELEASE) and [CourseInstance](/profiles/CourseInstance/1.0-RELEASE) profiles from the [Training Working Group](/groups/Training).

This release concludes the work of the Training Working Group who have now published the Course, CourseInstance, and [TrainingMaterial](/profiles/TrainingMaterial) profiles. These profiles are important due to their use for populating the content of the ELIXIR training portal [TeSS](https://tess.elixir-europe.org/) and more widely in the Global Organisation for Bioinformatics Learning, Education and Training ([GOBLET](https://www.mygoblet.org/)).

Example deployments of the profile can be found at [Bioinformatics.ca](https://bioinformatics.ca/workshops-all/2021-infectious-disease-epidemiology-analysis/), [EBI Training](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/events/metagenomics-bioinformatics-2022/), and [Bioschemas](https://bioschemas.org/meetings/2022-01_SWAT4HCLS_leiden).

Our thanks go out to [Patricia Palagi](/people/PatriciaPalagi) and [Michelle Brazas](/people/MichelleBrazas) for overseeing the finalising the Training Working Group's activities, and also to all members of the Training Working Group.
