We are pleased to announce another [BioHackrXiv](https://biohackrxiv.org) preprint from 2025. It reports on the work done during the past [BioHackathon Europe 2025](https://biohackathon-europe.org/) by the group [Mining the potential of knowledge graphs for metadata on training](https://github.com/elixir-europe/biohackathon-projects-2025/blob/main/18.md).

Abstract:

> Training metadata in the life‑science community is increasingly standardized through Bioschemas, yet remains fragmented and under‑utilized. 
> In this work we harvested training records from ELIXR’s TeSS platform and the Galaxy Training Network, converting them into a unified knowledge graph. 
> A dedicated pipeline parses RDF/Turtle dumps, deduplicates entries, and builds rich indexes (keyword, provider, location, date, topic) that power a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. 
> The MCP offers live and offline search tools—including keyword, provider, location, date, topic, and SPARQL queries—enabling natural‑language access to training resources via LLM‑driven clients. 
> User‑story driven evaluations demonstrate the system’s ability to generate custom learning paths, assemble trainer profiles, and link training data to external repositories. 
> Findings highlight gaps in persistent identifiers (ORCID, ROR) and location granularity, informing recommendations for metadata providers. 
> The project showcases how knowledge‑graph‑backed metadata can enhance discoverability, interoperability, and AI‑assisted exploration of scientific training materials.
