Visualizing computing results for manual inspection is important. Ammar Ammar published
(doi:[10.1186/s13321-021-00573-5](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-021-00573-5)) 0.6 million ligand-protein docking
experiments for 26 different protein structures with many single nucleotide polymorphisms in the online and open source
[PSnpBind database](https://psnpbind.org/). The protein summary pages are annotated with the
[Protein](https://bioschemas.org/profiles/Protein/0.11-RELEASE) 0.11-RELEASE profile, for example
for this [Urokinase-type plasminogen activator](https://psnpbind.org/protein/1owh).
