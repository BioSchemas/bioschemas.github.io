The [Datasets Group](https://bioschemas.org/groups/Datasets) have requested that the community consider the updated Dataset profile for release based on the [current 0.5-DRAFT](https://bioschemas.org/profiles/Dataset/0.5-DRAFT). The final version is available for [preview](https://hw-swel.github.io/bioschemas.github.io/profiles/Dataset/1.0-RELEASE).

This is an update to the [0.3-RELEASE](https://bioschemas.org/profiles/Dataset/0.3-RELEASE-2019_06_14) version. The main changes are updating the definition of properties to the latest Schema.org vocabulary definitions and making license a minimal property.

Please either comment on the [Pull Request](https://github.com/BioSchemas/bioschemas.github.io/pull/529) or raise new issues on the [GitHub tracker](https://github.com/BioSchemas/bioschemas/labels/type%3A%20Dataset). Comments should be submitted by 30 May 2022. The working group will respond to all issues raised by the community prior to the Steering Council voting on the acceptance of making the proposal a release version.

Many thanks to Egon Willighagen as well as the whole Bioschemas community for refreshing this profile.
