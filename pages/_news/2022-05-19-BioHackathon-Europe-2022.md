We are pleased to announce that the Bioschemas community have had three projects accepted at this year's [BioHackathon-Europe event](https://biohackathon-europe.org/) taking place in November.

The projects are:
- Bioschemas - Enabling profile updates through the Data Discovery Engine (DDE)
- Publishing and Consuming Schema.org DataFeeds
- Metadata schemas supporting Linked Open Science (with a focus on reproducibility)

These projects should give us the opportunity to engage with the wider community whilst refreshing our profiles; deepen our understanding of using dumps of data rather than harvesting pages; and push Bioschemas out into new areas.

Please come and join us in Paris (well outside of) and get involved with the exciting work that we'll take on during the week.
