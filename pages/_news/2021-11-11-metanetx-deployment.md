[MetaNetX](https://www.metanetx.org/), a database of automated model construction and genome annotation for large-scale metabolic networks, has deployed the [MolecularEntity profile](/profiles/MolecularEntity) on over 1 million pages. The pages have been indexed in a sitemap to enable the harvesting of data.

Keep an eye out for the outcomes of the BioHackathon 2021 to see what we've done with a sample of the data.
