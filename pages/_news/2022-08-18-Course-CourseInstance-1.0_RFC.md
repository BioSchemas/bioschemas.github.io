The [Training Working Group](https://bioschemas.org/groups/Training) have requested that the community consider the Course and CourseInstance profiles for release based on the [Course 0.9-DRAFT](https://bioschemas.org/profiles/Course/0.9-DRAFT-2020_12_08) and [CourseInstance 0.8-DRAFT](https://bioschemas.org/profiles/CourseInstance/0.8-DRAFT-2020_10_06) versions. The final versions are available for preview at [Course 1.0-RELEASE](https://hw-swel.github.io/bioschemas.github.io/profiles/Course/1.0-RELEASE) and [CourseInstance 1.0-RELEASE](https://hw-swel.github.io/bioschemas.github.io/profiles/CourseInstance/1.0-RELEASE).  
_Note that relative URLs do not work correctly on the preview deployment so some links will appear broken._

Please either comment on the [Pull Request](https://github.com/BioSchemas/bioschemas.github.io/pull/562) or raise new issues on the [GitHub tracker](https://github.com/BioSchemas/specifications/labels/topic%3A%20Course). Since we are entering the holiday period, we will keep the comments period open for 4 weeks. Comments should be submitted by 29 August 2022. The working group will respond to all issues raised by the community prior to the Steering Council voting on the acceptance of making the proposal a release version.

Many thanks to Patricia Palagi, Michelle Brazas, and Leyla Jael Castro as well as the whole Training Working Group for finalising these profiles.
