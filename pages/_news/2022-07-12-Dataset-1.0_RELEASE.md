We are pleased to announce the latest release of the [Dataset](https://bioschemas.org/profiles/Dataset/1.0-RELEASE) profile from the [Datasets Working Group](https://bioschemas.org/groups/Datasets).
This release represents a tidying up of the profile reflecting changes that have been made in the Schema.org vocabulary.

Example deployments of the Dataset profile can be found at [NanoCommons](https://nanocommons.github.io/datasets/) and [WikiPathways](https://wikipathways.org/).

We would encourage the community to update their deployments to comply with the latest release. To have your update reflected in the live deploys page, please update the entry for your dataset in this [file](https://github.com/BioSchemas/bioschemas.github.io/blob/master/_data/live_deployments.json) and make a pull request.
