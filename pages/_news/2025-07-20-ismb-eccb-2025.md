Professor Carole Goble (Bioschemas Steering Council) is joint chair of the [ISMB/ECCB 2025 conference](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2025/home) (Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology and European Conference on Computational Biology), hosted at ACC Liverpool, UK for the week of 20â€“24th July 2025.

The principal focus of this conference, run jointly by the International Society for Computational Biology ([ISCB](https://www.iscb.org/)) and [ECCB](https://eccb.org/), is the development and application of advanced computational methods to address biological problems. It brings together researchers from computer science, life sciences, mathematics, and related fields.

Several tracks are running in parallel, including the Bioinformatics Open Science Conference ([BOSC](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2025/programme-agenda/scientific-programme/bosc)), special interest groups for Bio-Ontologies and Knowledge Representation ([BOKR](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2025/programme-agenda/scientific-programme/bokr)) and [Education](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2025/programme-agenda/scientific-programme/education), and [Bioinformatics in the UK](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2025/programme-agenda/scientific-programme/uk).
