# Getting Started with Bioschemas
>_A quick tour on what this training portal offers_

{% include tutorial-navigation.html %}

[Bioschemas](/) aims to improve findability and interoperability for Life Science resources. It does so by guiding the use of [Schema.org](https://schema.org/) markup on Life Science websites. Guidelines include recommendations on the properties to be used together with the cardinality, ONE or MANY. It also offers recommendation on some well-known ontology terms for some particular properties. All those recommendations are what we call a "[__Bioschemas Profile__](/profiles)". Bioschemas also leads the development and posterior inclusion in Schema.org of some common types used in Life Sciences, i.e., [__Bioschemas types__](/types).

If what we just said is not so clear to you yet, do not worry about it; this training portal is here to help you understand how to use Bioschemas Types and Profiles. Find below the right place to start with.

We have identified four audience groups who might be interested in Bioschemas tutorials. On each tutorial, as part of the "audience" description, we will always include which group we think a tutorial mostly applies to. The four audience groups are:
* __General interest:__ people who want to get introduced to Bioschemas
* __Markup provider:__ _(aka content creator/web developer)_ people interested in adding Bioschemas markup to their web pages
* __Markup consumer:__ people who are interested in consuming the markup offered by the providers group
* __Specification developers:__ people who want to contribute to the creation and development of specifications (either types or profiles)

## Brief introduction to Schema.org and Bioschemas

All tutorials in this section target the _"General interest"_ audience group. If you fall in any of the other groups but are fairly new to the topic, we invite you to start your journey here.

- If you are new to Schema.org and Bioschemas, please start with [What and why Schema.org](./what_why_schema)
- If you already know about Schema.org and want to get a better understanding on structured data benefits, please have a look at our [pratical example on Schema.org markup](./markup_examples). _"Markup providers"_ and _"Markup consumers"_ will find initial information on how such markup looks like on the page and behind the scenes
- If you already know about Schema.org and want to learn more Bioschemas, please go to [What and why Bioschemas](./what_why_bioschemas)

## Markup How-to guidelines

The main target audience for these how-to guides are _"Markup providers"_. The secondary target audience are _"Markup consumers"_.

- If you already know about Schema.org and Bioschemas, and you are ready to add markup to your resource, then see our [Starting by the selection of the right profile for your case](./howto/howto_right_profile) guide.
- If you want to add Bioschemas structured data to your pages, use our guide to [add markup to your own resource](./howto/howto_add_markup)
- If you want to add markup to a GitHub pages site, see our guide for [marking up on GitHub pages](./howto/howto_add_github)
- To check that your markup is deployed and can be retrieved by others, see our guide on [checking your deployed markup](./howto/howto_check_deploy)

## Specification Development How-to Guides

The target audience for these how-to guides are _"Specification developers"_.

- If you want to [create a new profile](./howto/howto_create_new_profile), our _How to_ includes all the information you need to do so.
- If you need to create a new version of an existing profile then see guide to [updating a profile](./howto/howto_new_profile_version)

## Community-tailored tutorials

Life science communities, in particular ELIXIR communities, offer some tutorials tailored to their own needs. More information can be found on the [community-based tutorials page](./community/).
