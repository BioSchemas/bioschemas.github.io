      <h3>ELIXIR-EXCELERATE</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.elixir-europe.org/about-us/how-funded/eu-projects/excelerate">ELIXIR-EXCELERATE</a> is a
        HORIZON 2020 project to help ELIXIR coordinate and extend national and international data resources
        and ensure the delivery of world-leading life-science data services. It supports a pan-European training
        programme, anchored in national infrastructures, to increase bioinformatics capacity and competency.
        It also provides efficiencies in management and operation throughout the infrastructure, which is distributed
        amongst more than 20 European countries.
      </p>
      <p>ELIXIR-EXCELERATE is funded by the European Commission within the Research Infrastructures programme of Horizon
        2020, grant agreement number 676559.</p>

      <h3>ELIXIR Bioschemas: Community Adoption and Training</h3>
      <p>This <a
          href="https://www.elixir-europe.org/about-us/implementation-studies/bioschemas-community-adoption">implementation
          study</a> aims to lift Bioschemas from "pilot" to "practice" and will:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Disseminate and Train: Develop training material; improve the Bioschemas website; make compliant datasets
          visible in ELIXIR registries.</li>
        <li>Adopt: Topic specific workshops; Node-based workshops and inter-node staff exchange; strategic engagement
          with data platform Core Data Resources and implementation studies.</li>
        <li>Sustain: Incorporation into Schema.org; and establish Bioschemas Community governance.</li>
        <li>Impact: Highlight use cases, showcase impact stories and identify how to mitigate attrition.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Integrating ELIXIR Italy into ELIXIR activities</h3>
      <p>The <a
          href="https://www.elixir-europe.org/about-us/implementation-studies/integrating-elixir-italy-elixir-activities">implementation
          study</a> project plan of ELIXIR Italy consists of six activities that aim to boost the cooperation with
        existing ELIXIR activities and are expected to deepen the interaction between ELIXIR-IIB, the Joint Research
        Unit embodying the Italian Node, and ELIXIR. One of these activities is integration with the Bioschemas
        community.</p>

      <h3>ELIXIR Bioschemas Implementation Study</h3>
      <p>The aim of this <a
          href="https://www.elixir-europe.org/about-us/implementation-studies/bioschemas">Implementation Study</a> is to
        deliver Bioschemas specifications and demonstrators for the following content types: Data repository, Dataset,
        Sample and Protein annotations. Additionally it will support the development of other content types like
        Phenotype and Beacons planned in other ELIXIR activities. The project will also provide support and engagement
        of the Bioschemas community, including meetings, hackathons, knowledge dissemination, and training in adoption
        of Bioschemas. The project is led by the <a
          href="https://www.elixir-europe.org/platforms/interoperability/bioschemas">ELIXIR Bioschemas working
          group</a>.</p>
