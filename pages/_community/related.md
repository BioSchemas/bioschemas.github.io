# Bioschemas in Context

The major advantage of Schema.org markup is in making metadata readily accessible to common web tools, enabling their harvesting on a huge scale, by general and commercial indexers such as Google. Bioschemas is not alone in developing a strategy to generate a Life Science targeted, opinionated derivation of this markup. Other communities have adopted this general approach, and we provide examples below.

## Science On Schema
 The [ESIP](https://github.com/ESIPFed/science-on-schema.org) Science-On-Schema.org group has produced an evolving set of guidelines to assist with consistent implementation of scientific dataset descriptions using the Schema.org vocabulary. Indeed, the Science-On-Schema.org work is the output of one of several [groups](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/research-metadata-schemas-wg) operating in diverse domains, and targeting their own opinionated versions of Schema.org, ideally and ultimately to be integrated into Schema.org proper. A useful output of this group is a [crosswalk](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P6WH8h4OnIVR9UJj3FcOebNUpLnKNBCuvEp3NsLRho4/edit#gid=0) between Schema.org and other (and sometimes equivalent) properties expressed through other terminologies and standards. Note: other [crosswalks](https://zenodo.org/record/4420116#.YIMuFGhKg2y) are also available.

## GeoCODES

[GeoCODES](https://www.earthcube.org/geocodes) focuses on geoscience data and making it more discoverable on the Web. They are part of the science on schema initiative. They have also developed [Gleaner](https://gleaner.io/) as a toolkit for scraping the web. A prototype search service is available at [EarthCube](https://geocodes.earthcube.org/).

## Learning Resources Metadata Initiative

The Learning Resources Metadata Initiative [LRMI](http://www.lrmi.net/) have drafted extensions to the Schema.org vocabulary for marking up educational materials (summarised in this [blog post](https://blogs.pjjk.net/phil/learningresource-added-to-schema-org/)). These extensions are used in the Bioschemas [Course](/profiles/Course) and [TrainingMaterial](/profiles/TrainingMaterial) profiles.

## Schema.org Community Group

The [W3C Schema.org Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/schemaorg/) provide the environment for discussing extensions to the Schema.org vocabulary, and its best practice for usage. The community group is chaired by Dan Brickley (Google) with a [Steering Group](https://schema.org/docs/about.html#cgsg) drawn from representatives from Yahoo!, Yandex, Mircosoft, and Google.
