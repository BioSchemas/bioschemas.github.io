## 1. Profiles relevant for the plant sciences
- The [DataCatalog](https://schema.org/DataCatalog) profile should be used to markup the data portal/repository itself.
- The [Dataset](https://schema.org/Dataset) profile should be used to markup plant phenotyping, genotyping or omics datasets, in accordance with the MIAPPE-BioSchemas mapping provided below.
- The [Taxon](https://bioschemas.org/Taxon) profile is critical for the taxonomic identification of the subject of the data resources, down to the variety level if applicable, as this is key for findability.
- The [BioChemEntity](https://bioschemas.org/BioChemEntity) profile should be used for identifying the biological material below the taxonomic level, namely when it can be traced to a specific germplasm, seed lot or genotype.
- For plant omic resources, the key profiles are evidently [Gene](https://bioschemas.org/Gene), [RNA](https://bioschemas.org/RNA) and [Protein](https://bioschemas.org/Protein), but [Sample](https://bioschemas.org/Sample) may also be useful.
