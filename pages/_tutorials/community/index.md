# Community-based tutorials
>_A set of community-based tutorials around adding and consuming Bioschemas markup_

## 1. Why community-based tutorials
Communities bring together expertise around a particular topic, e.g., proteomics, training, metabolomics. Although the Bioschemas specifications are meant to be community-agnostic, community-based tutorials will include elements that are important for a particular community. For instance, they will use a language that is specialized to the community and familiar examples.

## 3. My community is interested in adding a tutorial

If your community is interested in adding a tutorial, we recommend you coordinate this effort with [coordinators of any of the Bioschemas groups](../../groups/) or one of the [Bioschemas champions](../../community/champions) as they can guide you and support you (and your community) in this effort. You can also send an email to the [Bioschemas mailing list](mailto:public-bioschemas-request@w3.org).
