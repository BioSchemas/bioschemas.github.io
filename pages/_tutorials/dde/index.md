# Data Discovery Engine
The [Data Discovery Engine (DDE)](https://discovery.biothings.io/) provides guidance for researchers on how to make their data discoverable and reusable, and bring the practical benefits of data sharing to researcher’s own research projects, as well as the research community as a whole. It was developed and is maintained by Dr. Chunlei Wu’s lab at the Scripps Research Institute and is supported by funding from the National Center for Data to Health (CD2H). The Data Discovery Engine has user-friendly tools which help with the extension and reusability of schemas.

You can use the DDE Schema Playground to:
