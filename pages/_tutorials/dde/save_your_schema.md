    <summary>Interpreting the validation warnings</summary>

  The DDE will automatically check your schema for JSON validation rules. 
  - If you are working on a type specification, ignore the warnings about validation as types do not use JSON Schema validation rules to apply property constraints
  - If you are working on a profile specification, you should revisit the DDE validation editor and add JSON Schema validation rules to the properties that lack them
