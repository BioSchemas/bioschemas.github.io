  <summary>Save your DDE-compatible JSONLD to the Bioschemas Specification Repository on GitHub</summary>
  
- The repo can be found at: https://github.com/BioSchemas/specifications
- You will need to create a new folder/directory for your specification **if** one does not already exist. Within that directory/folder, create another folder/directory for jsonld files named `jsonld`. There are several ways to do this:
 - [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo), edit it on your own fork and push your changes
 - Use the "[Add file](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/adding-a-file-to-a-repository)" button to add or upload a file
