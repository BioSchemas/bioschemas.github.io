    <summary> Understanding the search interface </summary>
    
  - The search box can be used to locate classes for various sources. Eg- a search for ‘CreativeWork’ gives 2 results: one from schema.org (schema namespace), one from outbreak.info (outbreak namespace)
  - The list of types (or classes) provided shows all the matches for your search, as well as describing what they are a subclass of, where appropriate.
  - The icon 'home' indicates the namespace for that class. For example, the 'home' icon followed by the linked term "schema" indicates that a class comes from schema.org
  - Each row in the table presented has an expandable ‘+’, where properties for that type are listed as a comma delimited list.

    <summary> Selecting an appropriate class </summary>
    
  - Note that all Schema.org classes are already registered and available from the DDE. They will be under the `schema` namespace (ie - it will have the term `schema` next to the little home icon
  - New types should generally be derived from existing schema.org or bioschemas classes (ie- parent namespace is `schema` or `bioschemastypes`
  - The bioschemas community has 5 namespaces within the DDE registry which help distinguish classes that are drafts, releases, types, profiles, and deprecated specifications.
  - You can compare up to 4 classes using by selecting classes by [clicking on the checkbox](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yl_aTm-od5U729-nVZWsGnl33oTDTS3NNlLzou60phI/edit#slide=id.g12bfbc3a89b_3_0) to select a class for comparison. Once you have selected the classes you’d like to compare, [click on the (not equal) icon](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yl_aTm-od5U729-nVZWsGnl33oTDTS3NNlLzou60phI/edit#slide=id.g1286c9c5fea_0_0)
  </details>

- If you are searching for a bioschemas specification, you can also search by namespace
  <details>
    <summary>The namespaces for bioschemas specifications are as follows</summary>
    
    - `bioschemas` = bioschemas profile specifications
    - `bioschemasdrafts` = bioschemas draft profile specifications
    - `bioschemastypes` = bioschemas type specifications
    - `bioschemastypesdrafts` = bioschemas draft type specifications
    - `bioschemasdeprecated` = deprecated bioschemas specifications
