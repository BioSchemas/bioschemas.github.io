    <summary> Understanding the search interface </summary>
    
  - The search box can be used to locate classes for various sources. Eg- a search for ‘CreativeWork’ gives 2 results: one from schema.org (schema namespace), one from outbreak.info (outbreak namespace)
  - The list of types (or classes) provided shows all the matches for your search, as well as describing what they are a subclass of, where appropriate.
  - The icon 'home' indicates the namespace for that class. For example, the 'home' icon followed by the linked term "schema" indicates that a class comes from schema.org
  - Each row in the table presented has an expandable ‘+’, where properties for that type are listed as a comma delimited list.

  - Note that all Schema.org classes are already registered and available from the DDE. They will be under the `schema` namespace (ie - it will have the term `schema` next to the little home icon
  - New types should generally be derived from existing schema.org or bioschemas classes (ie- parent namespace is `schema` or `bioschemastypes`
  - The bioschemas community has 5 namespaces within the DDE registry which help distinguish classes that are drafts, releases, types, profiles, and deprecated specifications.
  - You can compare up to 4 classes using by selecting classes by clicking on the checkbox to select a class for comparison. Once you have selected the classes you’d like to compare, click on the (not equal) icon
