  - The search box can be used to locate classes for various sources. Eg- a search for ‘CreativeWork’ gives 2 results: one from schema.org (schema namespace), one from outbreak.info (outbreak namespace)
  - The list of types (or classes) provided shows all the matches for your search, as well as describing what they are a subclass of, where appropriate.
  - The icon 'home' indicates the namespace for that class. For example, the 'home' icon followed by the linked term "schema" indicates that a class comes from schema.org
  - Each row in the table presented has an expandable ‘+’, where properties for that type are listed as a comma delimited list.
  - The bioschemas community has 5 namespaces within the DDE registry which help distinguish classes that are drafts, releases, types, profiles, and deprecated specifications.
