description: "The monoisotopic mass is the sum of the masses of the atoms in a molecule using the unbound, ground-state, rest mass of the principal (most abundant) isotope for each element instead of the isotopic average mass. Please include the units the form '<Number> <unit>', for example '770.230488 g/mol' or as '<QuantitativeValue>."
