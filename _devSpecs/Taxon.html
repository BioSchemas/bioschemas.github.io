  subtitle: Bioschemas specification for describing a biological taxon
  description: This profile aims to denote a taxon by common properties such as its
    scientific name, authority, taxonomic rank and vernacular names. It is also a
    means to link to existing taxonomic registers where each taxon has a URI.

- property: additionalType
  expected_types:
  - URL
  description: |-
    An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular those defined externally.
    BioChemEntity: Whenever a suitable profile exists, the profile type should be used in addition to the BioChemEntity type. Other additional types are always possible via the additionalType property. For instance, http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/PR_000000001 is the type used for the Protein profile but http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_010043 or https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8054 can be used as an additionalType if that results useful somehow to the data providers.
