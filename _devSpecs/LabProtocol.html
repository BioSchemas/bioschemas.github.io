  subtitle: Bioschemas specification describing LabProtocol in the life-science.
  description: An experimental protocol is a sequence of tasks and operations executed
    to perform experimental research in biological and biomedical areas.Experimental
    protocols are fundamental information structures that support the description
    of the processes by means of which results are generated in experimental research
    [1]. Experimental protocols describe how the data were produced, the steps undertaken
    and conditions under which these steps were carried out.<br />[1]  Giraldo, O.,
    García, A., López, F., & Corcho, O. (2017). Using semantics for representing experimental
    protocols. Journal of Biomedical Semantics, 8, 52. <a href="http://doi.org/10.1186/s13326-017-0160-y">http://doi.org/10.1186/s13326-017-0160-y</a>

  - URL
  description: An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific
    types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between
    something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use
    the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org
    tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular those defined
    externally.

    A particular case in Bioschemas is LabProtocol where structural elements are used to described advantages (situations the Protocol has been successfully employed), limitations (situations the Protocol would be unreliable or otherwise unsuccessful), applications (Applications of the protocol list the full diversity of the applications of the method and support if is possible to extend the range of applications of the protocol. e.g. northern blot assays, sequencing, etc.), and outcomes (outcome or expected result by a protocol execution).
    For LabProtocol, in the applicationType, please use [http://purl.org/net/SMARTprotocol#AdvantageOfTheProtocol](http://purl.org/net/SMARTprotocol#AdvantageOfTheProtocol) for advantages, [http://purl.org/net/SMARTprotocol#LimitationOfTheProtocol](http://purl.org/net/SMARTprotocol#LimitationOfTheProtocol) for limitations, [http://purl.org/net/SMARTprotocol#ApplicationOfTheProtocol](http://purl.org/net/SMARTprotocol#ApplicationOfTheProtocol) for applicability, and [http://purl.org/net/SMARTprotocol#OutcomeOfTheProtocol](http://purl.org/net/SMARTprotocol#OutcomeOfTheProtocol) for outcomes.
