  title: Tool
  subtitle: Bioschemas specification for describing a SoftwareApplication in the Life
    Sciences
  description: The Life Science Tools specification provides a way to describe bioscience
    tools and software on the World Wide Web. It defines a set of metadata and vocabularies,
    built on top of existing technologies and standards, that can be used to represent
    such tools in Web pages and applications. The goal of the specification is to
    make it easier to discover, exchange and integrate information about life science
    tools across the Internet.
